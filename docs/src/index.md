## Welcome to QSWalk.jl

*QSWalk.jl* is a package providing implementation of open continuous-time quantum walk evolution based on GKSL master equation. In particular we have implemented function useful for analysing local interaction, global interaction and nonmoralizing global interaction stochastic quantum walk models.

In GitHub we present an [examples](https://github.com/QuantumWalks/QSWalk.jl/) in .ipynb and .jl extension. The present most of the functionalities of the package. Furthermore, for package explanation we refer the user to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01294) describing the package, and
for the basic papers describing and introducing quantum stochastic models:
