## Bugs

In the case, you noticed some bugs, please start with an issue with a minimal
working example of not-working code. If *Exception* is thrown, please provide an
exception message as well.  If no *Exception* is thrown, but the result is
wrong, please provide in the issue message correct answer.

In the case you make a pull request, please add a not-working example as a test.

## Improvements

If you can provide a code, which works faster than already existing, please
check its efficiency for various input data. 

We welcome any ideas concerning the readability and logic of the code as well.

## Development guidelines
* Post an issue.
* Wait until the discussion ends.
* Create assertions on argument types and other requirements.
